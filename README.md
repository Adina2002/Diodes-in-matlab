In this project, I created a graphical interface to control and visualize various characteristics of a diode in an electrical circuit. The calculate_diode function is designed to calculate and display different aspects of a diode and the signal applied to it in an electrical circuit with the help of two popupmenu with which you can select the diode type and the desired signal type. Each button has an associated callback that is called when the user interacts with it. The callbacks update the relevant parameters and call back the interface_diode and calculate_diode functions to update the interface and recalculate the data and display it accordingly. A switch statement is used to set diode-specific parameters according to D-type. A switch statement is used to calculate the behavior of the signal depending on the S-type. In the graphic interface we can view the current-voltage characteristic of the diode and the graph of the voltage and current of the signal as a function of time. In conclusion, the graphical interface in Matlab is designed to display different aspects of a diode and the signal applied to it in an electrical circuit.
